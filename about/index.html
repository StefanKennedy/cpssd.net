<h1 id="about-cpssd">About CPSSD</h1>

<p>Computational Problem Solving and Software Development (CPSSD) is an
undergraduate computing course in <a href="https://dcu.ie">Dublin City University</a> that requires
applicants to have prior knowledge of programming. This means that students
can save time re-learning the basisc, and jump straight into making some
<a href="/projects">Cool Things</a>.</p>

<p>The course <a href="/blog/rip">had</a> a special admission procedure, Applicants do not need
to worry about points, but must submit a portfolio, pass an interview, achieve
the minimum DCU requirements, and pass honours maths.</p>

<h1 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170720163904/http://www.computing.dcu.ie/undergraduate/pssd/computational-problem-solving-software-development-cpssd">official CPSSD site</a> (now dead) described the course in details. It was
very dense, formal, with many typos, and with no way for us to edit them. Did
we mention its now gone too?</p>

<p>This site exists to give friendlier introduction to CPSSD, from the viewpoint
of the students, remembering how good of a course it was. It was not and is not
in any way official or endorsed by DCU.</p>
